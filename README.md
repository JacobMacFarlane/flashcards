# Biggest Challenges/Wins

## The biggest challenge i had was TDD but i also view it as my biggest win at the end, the TDD forced me to slow down my thinking and take a look at it from a different angle than i normally do and it has really helped me understand not only why its important but why you should do it, To me it was almost a better way to psueodcode than what i used to do which was just write out everything i think i needed to do.
